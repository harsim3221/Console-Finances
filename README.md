Description of the project:

I created a variable called Finances to store all the financial data for the entire period.
In order to check for the Total length of the months, I  used the variable - var arrayLength = finances.length and console.log("Total Months: " + arrayLength).
To calculate the total sum of the index, created - let sum=0 and added a value to this sum each time the loop runs.
For Average change, I checked for current value and the next index value to see the difference and then console it to get the results.
To check for the greatest increase and decrease in profit & loss, I googled it & used Math.max & Math.min feature to come to the solution.
